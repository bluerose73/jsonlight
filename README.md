# JSON Light

JSON Light is a fast JSON viewer that supports viewing string values as raw text.

## Why yet another JSON viewer?

Surprisingly, despite the number of JSON viewers, none of them are good at previewing long, multi-line string values. Fed up with crampted passages? Want ``\n`` to be displayed as linebreaks? JSON Light is your choice.

Besides, JSON Light is powered by the super fast JSON parser [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org/) and uses in-place parsing, therefore it is fast and memory-efficient.
