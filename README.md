# JSON Light

[JSON Light](https://bluerose73.github.io/jsonlight/) is a JSON viewer that can display string values as raw text.

## Why yet another JSON viewer?

Surprisingly, despite the number of JSON viewers, to my knowledge none of them are good at previewing long, multi-line string values. Are you tired of compact, cluttered passages? Do you wish for ``\n`` to be accurately displayed as line breaks? If so, JSON Light is the perfect choice for you.
